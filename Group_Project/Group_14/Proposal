##Title: EXPERT SYSTEM TO DETECT AND CLASSIFY PROSTATE CANCER

### Introduction
Expert System To Detect And Classify Prostate Cancer is a system to identify the presence of prostate cancer in men and 
classify the disease into various stages or types or risk groups. It is a specialised computer-based system that makes use 
of artificial intelligence techniques, including expert knowledge and machine learning. This technique boosts the precision 
and effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis and classification by fusing medical knowledge with data-driven algorithms. This 
system intended to help medical professionals diagnose and treat prostate cancer cases in a more consistent and developed manner. 
These systems attempt to increase early detection, decrease subjectivity, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by personalying 
treatment regimens to each patient's unique needs. They do this by fusing medical expertise with data-driven analysis.

### Problem Background

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers especially for men, with varying degrees of aggressiveness and potential for metastasis. In Malaysia, 1 in 117 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer which makes it the third most common cancer for a man in Malaysia after lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Before the invention of Artificial Intelligence,  doctors often combined clinical evaluations, biomarkers, and histological examination. These techniques, however, might be arbitrary, time-consuming, and not entirely accurate.

Expert systems, a subset of artificial intelligence, offer the chance to combine current medical data and knowledge to build a computer-based system that can help with prostate cancer identification and categorization. Expert systems can examine a variety of patient data, including medical histories, imaging results, and biopsy results, using machine learning models  to provide a more consistent and impartial method of diagnosis and classification.

### Problem Statement 

Prostate cancer is a serious health risk, and early detection and effective classification are essential for successful therapy. Although successful, the existing techniques for diagnosing and classifying prostate cancer frequently have subjectivity issues, require lengthy procedures, and have accuracy limitations. The diagnosis and classification of prostate cancer must be improved, thus it is necessary to create an expert system that makes use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and medical experience. Successful development of this system could significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of prostate cancer diagnosis and classification. Reducing subjectivity and optimizing the diagnostic process can lead to early detection and customized treatment plans, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
